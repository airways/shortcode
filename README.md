## Shortcode
Shortcode aims to allow for more dynamic use of content by authors and editors, allowing for injection of reusable bits of content or even whole pieces of functionality into any field in EE.

Shortcode provides two types of codes for use in any content in EE: user-defined Macros specific to each author and each site, as well as a simple API for third-party plugins and modules to expose their tags through the shortcode Rich Text Editor dialog (or manual entry in any type of field) - complete with automatically rendered options forms.

## Required Library
This add-on REQUIRES ProLib to be in your third_party directory. Get it here: https://github.com/airways/ProLib

## Two Types of Codes
 
Macros - User defined, author and site specific bits of reusable content - basically just like Snippets but can they can be embedded directly in any field type by your content Editors!
 
Shortcodes - Plugin/Module defined tags that can be injected into the middle of content, such as a ProForm form or other piece of functionality. This works similarly to the WordPress Shortcode API.
Features
 
## Macros
Macros defined by each user for their own use - each author could have the same macros defined with the same names, with different values that are dynamically replaced based on the assigned author of an Entry.
 
Macros defined by Super Admins for the entire site and usable in all content for each site (MSM compatible with separate sets of Macros for each site).
 
Macros and Shortcodes can be inserted manually in any fieldtype, or automatically through the included Rich Text Editor tool.
 
## Addon Shortcodes
A simple Shortcode API  allows for any Plugin or Module to provide custom Shortcodes complete with automatically generated configuration dialogs.
 
Existing plugins and modules can be converted to shortcodes with very little code. Assistance in the forum is available for anyone who wants to add support to their own add-ons.
   
Assistance writing glue code for existing plugins or modules is also available - just post a request for support for the plugin in the forum.
